2. **Select**: `Users` > `Add User`.
3. **User Details**:
   - **User Name**: `My_User`

   - **Password**: Select `Autogenerated Password` and check the box for `User must create a new password at next sign-in`.
4. Click `Next`.

## 2. Attach Policies Directly (Without Group Creation)
1. **Select** `Attach Policies Directly` to assign permissions without creating a group.
2. **Permissions**: Attach the following policies to the user `My_User`:
   - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
   - `IAMUserChangePassword`
   - `IAMFullAccess`
   - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
3. Click `Next`.

## 3. Add Tags
1. **Tag the User** for easier identification.
   - **Key**: `usertype`
   - **Value**: `devops`
2. Click `Next` to proceed.

---

## 4. Review and Create the User
1. **Review** all user details and permissions.
2. Click `Create User` to complete the setup.
3. Once created, download the `.csv` file containing the user's credentials or email it directly to the intended user.

---

## 5. Save Console Sign-In URL
1. Copy the **Console Sign-In URL** and save it securely for user access in incognito mode.

---

## 6. Sign in as New User (Incognito Mode)
1. Open the **Console Sign-In URL** in an incognito browser window.
2. **Log in** with the following details:
   - **Username**: `My_User`
   - **Password**: Use the autogenerated password provided in the `.csv` file or email.
3. **Password Reset**: The user `My_User` will be prompted to create a new password at first login.

## 7. Setting Up Identity Providers (Optional)
To allow access via identity providers such as GitHub or Azure:
1. Go to **IAM Console** > `Identity Providers`.
2. Select `Add Provider` and configure it according to your chosen identity provider (e.g., GitHub or Azure).

---

## 8. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Enhanced Security
1. In the **IAM Console**, navigate to `Users`, then select `My_User`.
2. Under **Security Credentials**, click `Assign MFA Device`.
3. **Authenticator Setup**:
   - Choose `Authenticator App` (e.g., Google Authenticator).
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to scan the QR code and enter the generated OTPs.
4. Once entered, MFA will be configured for the user `My_User`.

---

**Note**: For enhanced security, it is strongly recommended to enable MFA. 

This setup ensures that the IAM user `My_User` has the necessary permissions, tags, and security configurations to perform DevOps-related tasks in AWS.
